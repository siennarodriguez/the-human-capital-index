                    <p>Human capital consists of the knowledge, skills, and
                        health that people invest in and accumulate throughout

                        members of society. All data for 2020 represent the
                        status of countries pre-COVID-19 (sourced from World

                        <h2>What is the Human Capital Index?</h2>
                        <p>The Human Capital Index (HCI) measures the human
                            capital that a child born today can expect to attain
                            by the age of 18, given the risks of poor health
                            and poor education prevailing in her country. It
                            asks fundamental questions about whether a child
                            will survive, how healthy she will be growing up,
                            and whether she will attain real learning in school.
